Clustering is a broad set of techniques for finding subgroups of observations within a data set. When we cluster observations, we want observations in the same group to be similar and observations in different groups to be dissimilar. Because there isnâ€™t a response variable, this is an unsupervised method, which implies that it seeks to find relationships between the n observations without being trained by a response variable. Clustering allows us to identify which observations are alike, and potentially categorize them therein. K-means clustering is the simplest and the most commonly used clustering method for splitting a dataset into a set of k groups.
